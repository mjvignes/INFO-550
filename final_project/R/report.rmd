## Load data into R

For the purposed of this project, I decided to analyze the gene lengths of genes located on the 18th human chromosome.


## Cleaning and Analysis 


Basic data cleaning was performed by omitting missing data. Then, a new variable called gene length was created.


## Figures

By creating a histogram of the gene lengths, as show in Figure 1. below, we are able to visualize the distribution of gene lengths by each chromosome. But, as seen by this plot, a normal distribution is not the best fit for this data, therefore another histogram was created using a log scale to visualize data.

As we see in Figure 2., the log distribution of gene length more accurateley represents the length of genes on each chromosome.
