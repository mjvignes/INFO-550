# INFO-550
Final Project for INFO 550

For this project I will be looking at human genome data.

In order to start your analysis you will need to download the dataset "hg18genes.txt"

To analyze the data you will need to install some R packages. The required packages can be installed using R commands.
```{r, Package Installation, echo = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
      install.packages("BiocManager")
   BiocManager::install()
```
